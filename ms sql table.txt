LIKE-to turn on: % _
DISTINCT-remove duplicated records, no duplicated column values
IN-like WHERE but for multiple-WHERE last_name IN ('Foster', 'Elliott', 'Mitchell', 'Perry', 'Lawson')
BETWEEN/NOT BETWEEN-when we look a value in a range date or number
ALL-for multiple-WHERE salary > ALL (30000, 40000, 50000);
ANY-for multiple-WHERE salary = ANY (30000, 40000, 50000);
ORDER BY ASC/DESC-ORDER BY hire_date ASC, employee_id DESC;
UNION-combines the results of two sets, and removes duplicate records
UNION ALL-combines all results of sets and show all of them, duplicates are kept
INTERSECT-like UNION but show only the duplicates records of sets
EXCEPT-in the 1st set we remove the duplicated records between the 1st and the 2nd set
COUNT-count of records 
GROUP BY-show me these values and the count of each of these values
HAVING-similar to WHERE, but WHERE works only at the start of a query and HAVING is for the end of the query
SUM-the sum of all records of something-number
MIN-find the highest of maximum value-number, data, string
MAX-find the lowest or minimum value-number, data, string
AVG-finds the average value of a range of values-number
AS-rename column name
ON-works when joining multiple
CHARINDEX-in a string at what number position a char is located/CHARINDEX('@', email_address)
LEN-length of something 
SUBSTRING-gets a the part of a string/SUBSTRING(email_address, CHARINDEX('@', email_address), 100)
ROUND-rounds to the nearest whole number or specified decimal places/ROUND(price, 1)/ROUND(price * 9 * 0.85, 2)
CEIL-rounds up to nearest whole number. Short for "ceiling"/CEIL(price)
FLOOR-rounds down to nearest whole number/FLOOR(price)
TRUNCATE-empty the whole database//it auto commit so careful



- Aliases-shorter names for tables-like init variable:  
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, e.salary//e.salary
FROM employee e;//e

- Joins-it allow up to link 2 tables together in a single query

INNER JOIN(JOIN)-similar to UNION, but this is two tables, not two queries/combines the results of two sets, and removes duplicate records in 1 query instead of 2
LEFT JOIN - combines the results of two sets/from 2 tables shows table 1 + table 2 matches and the rest from table 2 that doesn't match table 1 its removed
RIGHT JOIN-reversed to LEFT JOIN - everything goes to the right to table 2 and the rest from table 1 its removed
FULL JOIN-combines 2 tables into 1 entirely 
CROSS JOIN-rarely used-every record in one table is joined to every record in another table

Self(JOIN) - join a table to itself(only 1 table), combine in 1 col all managers and employee/
Joining Many Tables- with ON,

- Functions: SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX, CHARINDEX, LEN, ROUND, CEIL, FLOOR

--- DateTime:
- GETDATE(): gets the current date/SELECT GETDATE()
- DATEADD: adds a number of months to a date value//DATEADD(MONTH, 6, hire_date) AS review_date//adds new review_date 6 months after hire_date
- DATEDIFF: finds the difference between two date values/DATEDIFF(MONTH, hire_date, GETDATE())/12 AS time_with_company//5.4 years

- CASE-if/then,else//when something add to price_group the string
CASE
WHEN price > 100 THEN 'Over 100'
WHEN price <= 100 THEN 'Less than or under 100'
END price_group








1.View everything:

Example UNION,UNION ALL,INTERSECT,MINUS:

- Query A has records 1, 2, 3, 4
- Query B has records 2, 4, 6, 8, 9

- UNION: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9
- UNION ALL: 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8, 9
- INTERSECT: 2, 4
- MINUS: 1, 3



Common Data Types:
Use TO_ to use them:

• CHAR: character string with fixed size
• VARCHAR2: character string with a variable size
• NUMBER: stores numeric data with optional decimals
• DATE: stores date and time
• TIMESTAMP: stores date, time, and fractional seconds
• CLOB: stores large amounts of text

TO_CHAR(hire_date, 'YYYY_MM_DD')-convert to a different format
SELECT TO_NUMBER('200')-convert to number
SELECT TO_DATE('2017_05_28', 'YYYY_MM_DD')-convert to a date

COMMIT;-commit changes 	

ROLLBACK;-revert query
